hi guys just a note<br> 
i followed a course from udemy but i rushed it so i don't understand every single thing<br>
but i believe its enough for what we want to do :D<br>

## HOW TO RUN

if you notice there are two main files ### frontend and ### restful-web-services
####frontend is run using REACT so when u click on it there will be another README file explaining how to run it.
but basically just run 
### `npm start`

if it doesn't work try 
### `npm cache clean --force`
### `npm rebuild`
### `npm install`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

but for this project i have set it to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)*

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
