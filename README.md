Hi guys just a note<br> 
i followed a course from udemy to get to this point but i rushed it so i don't understand every single thing<br>
but i believe its enough for what we want to do :D<br>

## HOW TO RUN

if you notice there are two main files 
#### frontend & restful-web-services
#### frontend 
is run using REACT so when u click on it there will be another README file explaining how to run it.
but basically just run 
### `npm start`

if it doesn't work try (in that order)
`npm cache clean --force`
`npm rebuild`
`npm install`
then run 
`npm start`

Then theres backend
#### restful-web-services 
resful-web-services/src/com/myapp/rest/webservices/restfulwebservices/RestfulWebServicesApplication.java

#### RestfulWebServicesApplication.java
when u get here, right click and *run java*
